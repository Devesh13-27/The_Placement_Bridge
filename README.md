# Placement Bridge

A private, invite-only portal connecting company HR teams and college
Training & Placement (T&P) officers — post openings, report interest,
message, and schedule recruitment camps / industry visits. No student
accounts, no payments, no resume parsing — just the core discover → talk →
schedule loop.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Row-Level Security)

## Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL editor, run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) — this
   creates all tables, RLS policies, and helper functions.
3. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your project's URL
   and keys (Project Settings → API):
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — safe for
     the browser.
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-only, used by the signup flow to
     create the org record and auth user before RLS would otherwise allow
     it. **Never expose this to the client.**
4. Install dependencies and run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Sign up once through the app (`/signup`) to create your own account,
   then promote yourself to admin directly in the Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   update profiles set role = 'admin', verification_status = 'verified',
     company_id = null, college_id = null where email = 'you@example.com';
   ```
   From then on, log in and use `/admin` to approve every new signup.

## How verification works

Signup requires an official (non-freemail) email address. The domain is
matched against existing colleges/companies, or a new pending org record is
created. Every new account starts `pending` and is invisible to the rest of
the platform until an admin approves both the person and their organization
from `/admin`. This is the trust layer the whole product depends on — no
student accounts, and no company or college can be impersonated.

## Core loop

- **HR** creates a posting → sees which colleges have logged interest →
  messages a T&P officer → proposes a camp/visit → marks the posting
  `camp_scheduled` / `closed`.
- **T&P** sees the feed of open postings → logs interested/eligible student
  counts for their college → messages the HR contact → confirms proposed
  camps/visits, tracked on `/college/camps`.
